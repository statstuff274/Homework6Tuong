    "text": "Task 1: Conceptual Questions\n\n1. What is the purpose of the lapply() function? What is the equivalent purrr function?\n\nThe purpose of the lapply() function is to apply a function over a list or vector, hence the “l” in lapply(), while returning a list of the same length where each element is a result from a function being applied to it. Notes - To further explain, apply() is to apply a function over something that’s homogenous, this is where the speed comes from. Help R states that lapply “returns a list of the same length as x, each element of which is the result of applying FUN to the corresponding element of x.”\n\n\nThe equivalent purrr function of lapply() is map(). Notes - the purrr package provides a tidyverse alternative to the apply() family. The main advantage here is more/greater consistency between functions and the addition of some helper functions. Hadley states that while using purrr, there’s less friction and greater ease while writing functional code.\n\n\n\n2. Suppose we have a list called my_list. Each element of the list is a numeric data frame (all columns are numeric). We want use lapply() to run the code cor(numeric_matrix, method = “kendall”) on each element of the list. Write code to do this below! (I’m really trying to ask you how you specify method = “kendall” when calling lapply()).\n\nThe code would be the following: lapply(my_list, FUN = function(x) cor(x, method = “kendall”)) Explanation: lapply() will apply a function over a list and return that list, my_list indicates the list, FUN = function(x) indicates that we’re going to create a function and pass its name to the FUN argument and cor(x, method = “kendall”) is how we would specify “kendell” when calling lapply().\n\n\n\n3. What are the two advantages of using purrr functions instead of the BaseR apply family?\n\nTwo advantages of using purrr functions over the BaseR apply family is: one, the purrr functions have helpers for writing compact code for common special cases, and two, there is much greater consistency between the functions. An example for the second advantage is, lapply() and mapply() both come from the BaseR family, however, for lapply, the first argument is the data and for mapply() the first argument is the function… as for the map functions in purrr, the first argument is always the data.\n\n\n\n4. What is a side-effect function?\n\nA side-effect function (is like print, write_csv(), plot(), etc.) is a function where it doesn’t try to change the data but just tries to produce something. It changes the state of something. For example, print(), prints something to the console, write_csv is creating a new file somewhere, plot() is creating a plot output somewhere. It’s not transforming the data, it’s just trying to produce something different.\n\n\n\n5. Why can you name a variable sd in a function and not cause any issues with the sd function?\n\nThis is because of the environments and lexical scoping, as well as how a function works. Lexical scoping (aka static scoping) refers to setting the scope/range of functionality, of a variable so that it can be called/referenced from within the block of code in which it’s defined… So, when you call a function, it creates temporary function environments (function scope). In these temporary function environments, variables in functions don’t overwite things. So even though you’re assigning a variable “sd” within a function, it doesn’t cause any issues with the actual sd function because it’s being assigned in a temporary function environment. This is why you can have the same name in a function and in your global environment, your variable in your function won’t override the global function making it not cause any issues with the sd function."
